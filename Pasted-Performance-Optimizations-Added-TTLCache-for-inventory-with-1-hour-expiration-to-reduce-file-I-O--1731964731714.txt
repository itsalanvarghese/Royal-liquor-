Performance Optimizations:


Added TTLCache for inventory with 1-hour expiration to reduce file I/O
Implemented LRUCache for product lookups
Added async/await support using aiohttp for external API calls
Optimized UPC validation with set lookups
Added file modification checking to prevent unnecessary inventory reloads
Used defaultdict for more efficient cart operations


Better Data Structures:


Implemented proper class structures for better organization
Added typing hints for better code clarity and IDE support
Used Decimal for precise price calculations
Implemented thread-safe operations with locks


Enhanced Error Handling:


Added comprehensive error handling throughout
Improved logging with more detailed formats
Added proper HTTP status codes
Better validation of inputs


Code Organization:


Split functionality into dedicated classes (CartManager, InventoryManager, etc.)
Better separation of concerns
More modular and maintainable code structure
Cleaner API response formatting


Rate Limiting:


Implemented a thread-safe RateLimiter class
More efficient rate limit checking
Better handling of retry scenarios


Memory Management:


Added proper cache eviction strategies
Better memory usage with appropriate data structures
Cleanup of unused resources


Security:


Added input validation
Proper encoding of URL parameters
Secure price handling with Decimal


API Improvements:


Consistent response formats
Better error messages
Proper status codes
Async support for external API calls

Key Benefits:

Faster response times due to caching and async operations
More reliable with better error handling

Better maintainability with clear code structure
More secure with proper input validation
More efficient memory usage
Better performance under load

To make this even better, you could:

Add database support instead of file-based storage
Implement proper authentication
Add request validation middleware
Add API versioning
Implement rate limiting per user/IP
Add monitoring and metrics
Implement proper test coverage
Add API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
Add proper config management
Implement
